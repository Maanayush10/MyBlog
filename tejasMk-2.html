                    <br class="hidden lg:inline-block">Is there a funding problem?
                </h1>
                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Tejas MK2 has recently been in the news again, and definetly not for good reason. The Tejas Mk 2 is intended to provide the Indian Air Force (IAF) with a 4.5-generation medium-weight-class fighter aircraft. The aircraft is designed to be an improvement over the fourth-generation Tejas Mk 1 aircraft currently in IAF service. But in many news channels and many reports recently it was mentioned that Tejas MK2 will have 5th generation capabilities- especially the stealth feautures.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">But are these all just Promises? The very first Tejas program took 40 years to implement and induct in our forces. Mistakes are defenitly better than very long, uneccesary delays. The Man behind Tejas <b>Kota Harinarayana</b>, has recently commented - <i>"India will soon have a ‘buffet spread’ of indigenously-built fighter aircraft to serve the needs of IAF"</i>, according to The Hindu. Only time will tell us, Kota sir. Delays due to Technical issues are another thing, and political delays are another thing.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">I personally feel, at this stage, when their is an ongoing shift in the world power, We need to have a strong defence sector as well as the forces. Our Airforce is the backbone of our defence. It helps us have peaceful days and calm nights. Good amount of Money should be spent on R&D, soldier's salary and pensions, and into insurance of soldier's family.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">It is also a possiblility that we may have developed a capability far more superior than what is being shown by other nations, but we are just hiding it. If that is the case, then our current government is way ahead of our time, and just trying to avoid a show. It is true that India needs to be away from the world Media, war, and other stuff for the next 20-30 years if she wishes to grow beyond the shackles of the west hedgemony. Only time will tell.
